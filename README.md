+ Plugin
  + PassiveCircuits.js
  + MetaData.json
+ Elecrical Circuits Webgme branch


**Testing**

1) Import the Electrical Circuits branch. It has a metamodel of examples which has circuits and components. The plugin is generated for circuits and since it is contained within Examples, the plugin applis to any circuit designed within the examples. I have an example of RLC circuit for which I have run my plugin. The artifacts are for the RLC example.

2) Now add the plugin to the project and run the example. 

3) The plugin generates two json files one called circuittree which has the structure of the circuit and the other is circuitmeta which has the metadata.
